homebrew-octave-app
=====================

Homebrew formulae for Octave.app.

This is the tap for the [Octave.app project](https://github.com/octave-app), which bundles GNU Octave into a macOS Octave.app app bundle.

These formulae are intended primarily for use in the bundled app, so they have minimal options defined in them, and may have other special tweaks to work correctly in this context. They are also not intended to coexist with their non-versioned variants, so they do not have `keg_only` or `conflicts_with` defined. They will not work if you try to install them into a regular Homebrew installation.

This tap lives at https://github.com/octave-app/homebrew-octave-app. Please report any bugs there.
